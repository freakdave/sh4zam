    \brief   Example of pushing polygons with SH4ZAM.
    \ingroup examples

    Welcome to Bruce's Balls!

    The following example illustrates the use of SH4ZAM to accelerate
    rendering and vertex processing. It also serves as a performance
    benchmark at the high-end, capable of pushing 4.5 million polygons
    per second with the proper build flags.

    The program simply renders a series of high-polygon balls and reports
    back the rendering performance in terms of polygons per second. It
    does so by using KOS's "Direct Rendering" PVR API, which submits geometry
    to the PowerVR GPU via filling and flushing the two store queues to the
    TA in alternation. Ths is the fastest rendering path. 

    \note
    This example is written in C23.
